'''Objective 
For the get_score(game_stamps, offset) function developed in the previous task, develop unit tests using the unittest framework.
The tests should cover all possible use cases of the function, focus on testing a single case, not be repetitive, and the 
test names should reflect the essence of the checks being performed.
